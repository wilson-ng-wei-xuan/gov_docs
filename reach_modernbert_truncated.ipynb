Cost of living high, but government also doing their part to help us. Like the PASE (Progressive Wage Model) and other initiatives to upskill workers. Not only tuition fees or house prices increase lah, but lifestyle too. Must learn to manage money better also, can help ourselves. Otherwise keep blaming the government, how? Think they can solve everything ah? Better to look at what we can do, like improving ourselves, then can earn more.\\nContributor232: Perhaps we should also consider how the shifting job market influences wage dynamics and the type of jobs available to residents.\\nContributor677: Perhaps we should also consider how individual financial literacy can empower households to better navigate these challenges.\\nContributor232: While the governments support for low-income households is crucial, it might also be worth considering how individual financial literacy and personal budgeting can play significant roles in managing household expenses amidst rising costs.\\nContributor576: While I understand the concerns about rising costs, it\\u2019s essential to recognize that many households have adapted by finding innovative ways to budget and maximize their spending, such as embracing community initiatives that provide shared resources.\\nContributor232: Are we considering the role of private sectors and businesses in wage growth and support for low-income households as part of the solution?\\nContributor679: Great to see initiatives like SkillsFuture that empower individuals to upskill and adapt to the changing job market, which can help mitigate rising costs in the long run.\\nContributor836: Perhaps exploring more sustainable economic growth strategies could be the key to addressing this ongoing concern.\\nContributor543: Have we considered the potential role of private sector initiatives in addressing wage growth and supporting low-income households alongside government measures?\\nContributor266: While government measures are important, we should also consider the role of personal financial planning and how individuals can adapt to rising costs.\\nContributor843: While I understand the concerns about the cost of living, one might also consider how increased spending can actually drive local businesses and stimulate job creation, benefiting the economy as a whole.\\nContributor838: I strongly believe that expanding the SkillsFuture initiative to include more targeted training programs for digital skills is essential. In todays job market, many industries are rapidly shifting towards technology-driven operations. For example, if we can provide training for data analytics or cybersecurity, it will empower both employees and employers to adapt to these changes. It\\u2019s not just about basic computer literacy; advanced tech skills can lead to job security and career growth. Offering subsidies for these specific courses can attract more individuals to upgrade their skills., Additionally, I think its important to have greater access to SkillsFuture credits for older workers who may have been in the same job for many years. A tailored program that helps them transition into new roles could alleviate some employment issues we see in the senior demographic. For instance, vocational training for in-demand skills in healthcare or renewable energy can diversify their career options. Its about making sure that no one is left behind in this evolving job landscape.\\nContributor848: While investing in skills is essential, one must consider how accessible these opportunities are for everyone, as not all individuals may have the same ability to take advantage of them.\\nContributor376: While I understand the value placed on SkillsFuture, Ive seen many people who still struggle to utilize the skills theyve acquired in real-world scenarios, almost like buying a fancy kitchen appliance that just sits there unused.\\nContributor838: Its interesting to think about how my uncle used SkillsFuture to upskill in digital marketing, but I wonder if we should also prioritize making these resources more accessible to those who may not be tech-savvy or have time to learn.\\nContributor140: While SkillsFuture is essential, we must ensure that the training programs align closely with the actual needs of the job market.\\nContributor548: While its vital to support lifelong learning, could we consider how we might better tailor these programs to the specific needs of different industries?\\nContributor636: While lifelong learning is important, its equally crucial to assess whether the current programs truly address the skills gap in our specific industry needs.\\nContributor632: Aiyoh, but not everybody can benefit from SkillsFuture lah, some people really need other types of support to find their way in the job market, you know?\\nContributor838: Yet, we should also consider the accessibility and effectiveness of these programs for all demographics, as not everyone benefits equally from such initiatives.\\nContributor372: While the SkillsFuture initiative is indeed valuable, one must consider whether sufficient awareness and utilization of these resources are being achieved across all demographics, particularly among those who may not be actively seeking to upskill.\\nContributor140: While lifelong learning is essential, we should also consider how accessible resources are for those who may have financial or time constraints, as not all individuals can equally benefit from expanded initiatives like SkillsFuture.\\nContributor554: I must express my strong disagreement with the notion that reducing the foreign worker quota will inevitably lead to labor shortages and negatively impact local job opportunities. In fact, this decision can be seen as a long-overdue catalyst for innovation and efficiency within our local businesses.A key point to consider is the potential for increased automation and technological adoption in response to a reduced foreign workforce. Companies may accelerate their investments in technology-driven solutions, streamlining operations, and improving productivity. For instance, small businesses might adopt tools like Artificial Intelligence and robotics to manage tasks that were previously performed by foreign workers. This shift not only helps mitigate labor shortages but also positions local enterprises to become more competitive in global markets.Moreover, with a tighter labor market, businesses may be compelled to offer more attractive salary packages and better working conditions to retain local talent. This can enhance job satisfaction and improve worker retention rates. Ultimately, this could lead to a more skilled and motivated workforce, creating a positive cycle that benefits local communities.Let\\u2019s also consider the importance of nurturing local talent. By prioritizing local hires and reducing reliance on foreign workers, we can invest in training and upskilling programs for Singaporeans. This investment in human capital helps ensure that local workers are better equipped for a rapidly changing job landscape, ultimately benefiting our economy.In conclusion, the anticipation of labor shortages and increased costs need not overshadow the potential benefits of this policy decision.

As Albert Einstein famously said, The measure of intelligence is the ability to change. We need to adapt our education system to focus more on critical thinking and creativity rather than just digital skills., Moreover, theres an inherent danger in emphasizing digital literacy as if it\\u2019s the sole solution. As Martin Luther King Jr. once remarked, Intelligence plus character\\u2014that is the goal of true education. We should be fostering well-rounded individuals capable of ethical decision-making rather than just digitally savvy ones.\\nContributor87: Its interesting how sometimes people equate digital literacy solely with technical skills, whereas understanding online etiquette and critical thinking is equally vital in this digital age.\\nContributor567: While enhancing digital literacy programs is one approach, we should also consider leveraging existing resources and partnerships to provide a more immediate impact on citizens skills and confidence in a digital economy.While digital literacy is important, we should also consider investing in hands-on practical experience and mentorship programs, as they can often provide more immediate and applicable skills for individuals in their daily lives.\\nContributor837: Perhaps we should also consider how access to technology itself might impact the effectiveness of digital literacy programs.\\nContributor668: Maybe instead of focusing solely on digital literacy, we should consider the importance of critical thinking skills to help people assess the information more effectively.\\nContributor567: What about focusing on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship instead?

Instead, I believe enhancing opportunities for economic growth and education might yield better long-term results. For example, when I was a young adult, I found that investing in my skills and pursuing higher education not only improved my job prospects but also helped me manage financial challenges more effectively.Moreover, I think we should focus on fostering a culture of self-reliance rather than increasing dependence on government assistance. Like many others, I\\u2019ve faced tough financial times, yet I learned to budget and save wisely. The skills I developed during those times have served me well and instilled a sense of financial responsibility that I would prefer to see promoted over handouts.Furthermore, there are many successful initiatives that drive entrepreneurship and innovation within our communities. For instance, look at the hawker culture in Singapore; many families have thrived by creating their own small businesses. Supporting these entrepreneurial ventures could be a more effective avenue for addressing economic burdens rather than more government financial aid.I respect the viewpoint that immediate assistance might seem necessary, but I believe a holistic approach, considering the root causes of the economic pressures, would yield better outcomes. Encouraging a robust economic environment would allow individuals to lift themselves up with their capabilities and tenacity.\\nContributor641: But ah, maybe the focus should also be on creating more job opportunities loh, so people can earn more instead of just relying on assistance?\\nContributor253: The effectiveness of financial assistance programs may also depend on how well they are communicated to those who need them the most.\\nContributor148: While financial assistance is essential, enhancing employment opportunities and job training programs could also significantly support families in the long run.\\nContributor253: Perhaps instead of solely increasing financial aid, we could also focus on enhancing job training programs to help families improve their income potential in the long run.\\nContributor805: Its interesting to consider that while targeted financial assistance is essential, perhaps we should also explore initiatives that promote long-term financial literacy and empowerment for these families.But hor, maybe we should also think about how to boost wages for these families leh, so they can keep up without always relying on assistance.\\nContributor730: Could exploring alternative solutions, such as community support initiatives, also play a role in addressing the financial pressures faced by families?\\nContributor985: While I understand the concern for targeted financial assistance, I wonder if focusing solely on temporary relief might overlook the need for more sustainable solutions, like job creation or skills training, similar to how a garden needs consistent care rather than just occasional watering to flourish.\\nContributor540: Perhaps enhancing job opportunities and skills training could be a more effective approach.\\nContributor130: While financial assistance is important, perhaps we should also consider investing in skills training and education programs for these families to help them secure better-paying jobs in the long run.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"human_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"agree\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<s>[INST]Determine whether Contributor728 holds the same view as this statement: 'Contributors expressed concern over the government's recent decision to reduce the foreign worker quota in various sectors, arguing that this could lead to labor shortages and increased operational costs for small businesses, ultimately affecting job opportunities for local workers as firms may restructure to cope with higher wages.\\u2019?

In todays job market, many industries are rapidly shifting towards technology-driven operations. For example, if we can provide training for data analytics or cybersecurity, it will empower both employees and employers to adapt to these changes. It\\u2019s not just about basic computer literacy; advanced tech skills can lead to job security and career growth. Offering subsidies for these specific courses can attract more individuals to upgrade their skills., Additionally, I think its important to have greater access to SkillsFuture credits for older workers who may have been in the same job for many years. A tailored program that helps them transition into new roles could alleviate some employment issues we see in the senior demographic. For instance, vocational training for in-demand skills in healthcare or renewable energy can diversify their career options. Its about making sure that no one is left behind in this evolving job landscape.\\nContributor848: While investing in skills is essential, one must consider how accessible these opportunities are for everyone, as not all individuals may have the same ability to take advantage of them.\\nContributor376: While I understand the value placed on SkillsFuture, Ive seen many people who still struggle to utilize the skills theyve acquired in real-world scenarios, almost like buying a fancy kitchen appliance that just sits there unused.\\nContributor838: Its interesting to think about how my uncle used SkillsFuture to upskill in digital marketing, but I wonder if we should also prioritize making these resources more accessible to those who may not be tech-savvy or have time to learn.\\nContributor140: While SkillsFuture is essential, we must ensure that the training programs align closely with the actual needs of the job market.\\nContributor548: While its vital to support lifelong learning, could we consider how we might better tailor these programs to the specific needs of different industries?\\nContributor636: While lifelong learning is important, its equally crucial to assess whether the current programs truly address the skills gap in our specific industry needs.\\nContributor632: Aiyoh, but not everybody can benefit from SkillsFuture lah, some people really need other types of support to find their way in the job market, you know?\\nContributor838: Yet, we should also consider the accessibility and effectiveness of these programs for all demographics, as not everyone benefits equally from such initiatives.\\nContributor372: While the SkillsFuture initiative is indeed valuable, one must consider whether sufficient awareness and utilization of these resources are being achieved across all demographics, particularly among those who may not be actively seeking to upskill.\\nContributor140: While lifelong learning is essential, we should also consider how accessible resources are for those who may have financial or time constraints, as not all individuals can equally benefit from expanded initiatives like SkillsFuture.\\nContributor554: I must express my strong disagreement with the notion that reducing the foreign worker quota will inevitably lead to labor shortages and negatively impact local job opportunities. In fact, this decision can be seen as a long-overdue catalyst for innovation and efficiency within our local businesses.A key point to consider is the potential for increased automation and technological adoption in response to a reduced foreign workforce. Companies may accelerate their investments in technology-driven solutions, streamlining operations, and improving productivity. For instance, small businesses might adopt tools like Artificial Intelligence and robotics to manage tasks that were previously performed by foreign workers. This shift not only helps mitigate labor shortages but also positions local enterprises to become more competitive in global markets.Moreover, with a tighter labor market, businesses may be compelled to offer more attractive salary packages and better working conditions to retain local talent.

It\\u2019s about resilience and adapting to the situation at hand.\\nContributor230: But havent we also seen some innovative housing solutions emerging that could provide more options for these young families?While its true that housing prices are steep for young families, as Oscar Wilde said, Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.\\nContributor484: Its true that housing prices are a concern, but as John F. Kennedy once said, Change is the law of life, and sometimes, these shifts can lead to new opportunities.\\nContributor812: While concerns about rising out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare are valid, I wonder if there are alternative approaches to consider rather than solely reviewing MediShield Life. For instance, focusing on preventive care could significantly reduce overall healthcare costs in the long run. If the government invested more in community health programs aimed at educating the public about healthy lifestyles, we could see a decrease in chronic illnesses, which are a primary driver of high medical expenses.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, by promoting early intervention and regular health screenings, patients could avoid more costly treatments down the line. Countries with strong preventive care strategies tend to have better health outcomes and lower healthcare spending, which could serve as a model for Singapore. Its an interesting avenue that could complement discussions about MediShield Life.\\nContributor560: Isnt it also worth considering how individuals can actively manage their health and expenses, potentially reducing the need for extensive coverage in the first place?\\nContributor494: This isnt just about MediShield Life; perhaps we should consider enhancing personal responsibility for healthcare decisions instead.\\nContributor80: But ah, we also need to think about how to balance premiums leh, otherwise how to sustain the system long-term?\\nContributor494: Aiyoh, maybe if we just use our insurance wisely and plan ahead, can save kway teow, yknow?\\nContributor812: Its interesting how some people find that planning ahead, like saving for education, can alleviate unexpected costs later on; perhaps a similar mindset could be applied to healthcare expenses.\\nContributor306: \\u201cPerhaps looking into more preventive care initiatives could help reduce those expenses in the long run.\\u201d\\nContributor94: Some may argue that personal responsibility in health choices can also play a role in managing these costs.\\nContributor929: I think we shouldn\\u2019t always jump to changing the system; sometimes, being more mindful about our own health can prevent those high costs in the first place.\\nContributor566: Perhaps we should also consider the importance of personal responsibility in managing our own health costs.\\nContributor306: Indeed, as Benjamin Franklin once said, An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, which suggests that perhaps focusing on preventive care could alleviate some of these rising costs in the first place.\\nContributor630: Existing resources are adequate and better allocation is needed.\\nContributor449: While funding and awareness are crucial, we should also explore how integrating mental health education into schools could proactively address stigma before it becomes entrenched in these communities.But hor, maybe we also need to consider how to involve community leaders so they can help reduce the stigma more effectively ah.\\nContributor314: Eh, but how come nobody talk about personal responsibility ah? Like, why not focus on families taking charge of their own well-being instead of relying on government help?While stigma is a concern, perhaps addressing the root causes of stress in low-income families could be a more effective approach.\\nContributor222: In reality, we might need to consider whether more funding for mental health services actually addresses the root causes of the issue, as low-income families often struggle with various systemic challenges beyond just mental health.\\nContributor446: But like, isnt it also important to think about how we could involve community leaders in promoting these resources ah?\\nContributor950: Its also important to consider the role of community support in fostering a safe environment for discussions around mental health.\\nContributor222: While its admirable to push for more resources, Ive often seen that just adding services doesnt automatically change peoples views on seeking help.\\nContributor630: But isnt it more effective if we focus on empowering families through education and job opportunities, rather than just funding mental health resources?\\nContributor449: While increasing funding and awareness are crucial, we should also explore integrating mental health education into school curriculums to address stigma from a young age and foster a more supportive environment.\\nContributor950: Its also important to consider whether the available resources are culturally sensitive and truly meet the unique needs of these families.\\nContributor222: While it\\u2019s important to address mental health, perhaps we should also focus on creating community-based programs that foster connection and resilience among families, rather than just emphasizing counseling as a solution.\\nContributor404: What if we also consider incorporating community-based support systems that allow families to connect with peers experiencing similar challenges, rather than just focusing on professional counseling?\\nContributor129: Its important to consider that while funding and resources are essential, there may be more effective approaches like community-led initiatives that empower individuals to support each other in mental health matters instead of solely relying on government services.\\nContributor222: While addressing mental health is crucial, perhaps we should consider that the greatest wealth is to live content with little, as it may lead us to rethink our approaches instead of solely increasing resources.\\nContributor449: In addition to funding and awareness, we should also consider integrating mental health education into school curriculums as part of a long-term solution.\\nContributor630: While the intention behind enhancing mental health resources is commendable, one must consider that simply increasing funding does not guarantee effective utilization; we should focus on community-driven initiatives that empower families to address their challenges in culturally relevant ways.\\nContributor213: While increasing funding is crucial, its also essential to ensure that the counselors are properly trained to understand the unique challenges faced by low-income families, as not all support will be effective without this foundational understanding.\\nContributor129: Sometimes, the best way to help is to empower individuals to find their own solutions; as Gandhi said, You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\\nContributor150: Its interesting to consider the role of schools in the mental health support structure for youth. For example, some schools have implemented counseling programs that provide students with access to mental health professionals on-site., That\\u2019s a valid point, and I\\u2019ve heard that peer support groups within schools can also contribute positively.\\nContributor906: Perhaps its worth considering how societal expectations and pressures might also play a role in youth mental health, influencing their ability to seek support.\",\n          \"Contributor32: Its like when you go out for a meal and suddenly notice that your favorite dish costs more than it used to; it makes you rethink your choices and sometimes even leads you to try something new.\\nContributor161: Its interesting to note that while the focus is on affordability for families, theres also a perspective that highlights how different regions in Singapore might be experiencing these costs very differently, potentially affecting local businesses and their operations.\\nContributor934: Have we considered the potential benefits of exploring alternative income sources or investments to help families cope with these rising costs?\\nContributor751: While addressing the rising cost of living is crucial, we should also consider how enhancing financial literacy among low- and middle-income families could empower them to manage their resources more effectively.\\nContributor175: Aiyoh, but some say gotta encourage people to adapt and find ways to earn more, not just rely on help, right?\\nContributor161: Have we considered the potential benefits of encouraging more sustainable lifestyles as a solution?\\nContributor618: While support for low- and middle-income families is crucial, we also need to consider how enhancing skills and education might empower them to better navigate the cost of living.\\nContributor985: I agree that transparency in government initiatives is crucial, especially when we talk about the rising cost of living. For instance, I think detailed explanations of how subsidies for essential goods are calculated could greatly help citizens understand their financial decisions better. Just look at the recent Pioneer Generation Package; many seniors still are unsure what benefits they qualify for and how to access them. If the government provided more clear guidelines and accessible information, it would allow people to make better choices regarding their spending. ,Yet, I wonder if the government might be holding back some information, especially regarding the long-term sustainability of these measures. Just like the recent hike in utility prices, understanding the reasons behind these adjustments could help alleviate public frustration. If there were more regular updates, akin to monthly briefings about what to expect in terms of economic changes, at least we could be more prepared and informed. \\nContributor731: I think sometimes too much transparency can overwhelm people; like when I plan a trip, too much information can lead to confusion instead of clarity.\\nContributor359: While transparency is crucial, we also need to consider how swiftly implementing new initiatives can lead to confusion among citizens, especially if information isnt synchronized across different platforms.\\nContributor731: People need to take personal responsibility for their finances; relying too much on government communication can lead to complacency, as seen in past housing booms.Its important to recognize that too much transparency can lead to confusion and misinterpretations among citizens, potentially complicating rather than clarifying their understanding of initiatives.In fact, too much transparency might lead to confusion rather than clarity for citizens.\\nContributor635: While clearer communication is essential, fostering a culture of financial literacy might empower citizens even more profoundly.\\nContributor769: Aiyoh, maybe more transparency not necessarily help leh; sometimes too much information just confuse people more, you know?\\nContributor635: While I agree that transparency is important, I wonder if it might also create an overwhelming amount of information that could confuse rather than clarify for some citizens, much like how too many choices at a hawker centre can make it hard to decide on a meal.\\nContributor759: While clearer communication is important, we should also recognize that some citizens might benefit more from comprehensive support programs rather than just information; for instance, initiatives like subsidized transport or food vouchers have tangible impacts on daily expenses.\\nContributor295: Perhaps we should consider that as Benjamin Franklin said, An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest, and empowering citizens with data might be more beneficial than just transparency alone.\\nContributor731: Sometimes less information can actually lead to simpler decisions in a complex economic landscape.\\nContributor23: Transparency is like sunlight; it eradicates the shadows of doubt, but even the clearest days can have clouds.\\nContributor731: Aiyoh, I think we should just trust the government to know what they doing lah, no need to question so much.\\nContributor759: Isnt it more important to focus on practical solutions rather than transparency?\\nContributor23: Perhaps it\\u2019s also worth considering how different demographics might perceive the same information differently.\\nContributor39: Indeed, while transparency is vital, its also crucial to ensure that the information shared is actionable; for instance, if citizens are given clear insights into available subsidies or assistance programs, they could more effectively manage their budgets during times of economic strain.\\nContributor359: It\\u2019s interesting you mention transparency, but I cant help but think that some programs might benefit from less visibility to avoid overwhelming citizens with information overload.\\nContributor576: Increased grants sound beneficial, but how about the timing of these updates?, Affordable homes are crucial, but are current infrastructure capacities keeping pace?\\nContributor805: Its crucial to also consider innovative housing solutions, like mixed-use developments, that can maximize land use while providing affordable options.\\nContributor100: More focus on increasing the variety of housing types could help cater to different needs and preferences in our growing population.\\nContributor196: While its great to see support for increased grants, one might recall that the best way to predict the future is to create it, and perhaps we should look at innovative housing solutions that can efficiently increase the supply.\\n\\n\\nContributor805: Maybe we can also look at build-to-order schemes to make better use of land, since supply really tight sia.\\nContributor570: But can we really believe that increased grants will solve the fundamental issue? As Gandhi said, The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. We need to focus on serving the communitys needs more directly instead of just throwing money at the problem.\\nContributor790: Its crucial to consider not just the financial aspects for first-time buyers but also the potential impact of increasing supply on the long-term sustainability of our urban environment.\\nContributor570: Increased grants alone may not solve the underlying issues of affordability; we might need to reconsider the overall planning strategies instead.\\nContributor545: The increased grants are a positive step, but we should also consider diversifying housing options to better meet the diverse needs of our population.\\nContributor196: While increased grants are certainly helpful, isnt it equally crucial to consider innovative housing solutions to complement those financial aids?Its like trying to fit everyone into a cafe that has only a few tables; even with more discounts on the food, we need to expand the space if we want everyone to sit comfortably.\\n\\n\\nContributor27: But what about sustaining the quality of living in existing neighborhoods?\\nContributor570: But shouldnt we also consider the potential long-term implications of continuously increasing the grants?\\nContributor448: Isnt it interesting how managing housing supply can sometimes feel like trying to solve a Rubiks Cube\\u2014every move affects another aspect, and what looks good in one direction might complicate things elsewhere?\\nContributor196: While increased grants are helpful, I wonder if they might inadvertently lead to price inflation in the housing market, as seen in previous years when subsidies were introduced.\\n\\n\\nContributor100: Its interesting to consider that while increasing grants is a step in the right direction, it might not fully address the underlying issues of land scarcity and urban planning that contribute to the affordable housing crunch.\\nContributor196: While addressing the supply shortage is crucial, we also need to consider how to maintain the quality and sustainability of these new affordable homes being built.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"human_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"disagree\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic_group\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"national_day\",\n          \"budget\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agreement\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"majority\",\n          \"unanimous\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"user\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 229,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cb58a6f8-2604-4b8d-a0d9-b9718cc134af\",\n          \"5419fb94-a5af-46ee-b019-ee1e52cc006e\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"group_user\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 234,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"45419fb94-a5af-46ee-b019-ee1e52cc006e\",\n          \"20c58c1ab-6e81-406a-9609-21b23cad0f62\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
