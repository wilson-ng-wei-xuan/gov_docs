Dear Mr. Jay,
Thank you for your feedback and apologies for the delay in communications.

As Skypark by AJ Hackett is operated by a separate business entity and we are currently in touch with the relevant partners, we seek your kind understanding to allow us additional time to check with the AJ Hackett team regarding the deduction of tokens from your FUN Pass on 23 November 2021. 

We will be in touch with you again once we have concluded the investigation with AJ Hackett Team.

Should you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us again via this email.

Subject: Guest feedback on unknown deduction of tokens 

Hi GIE & Team, 
 
There was a guest who approached us at Beach Ticketing Counter on a issue he was 
facing with tickets that was bought online. He had 2 tickets of 100 Tokens each 
and it was bought on the 09th Nov 2021. (Please see attached for tickets)

Guest recalled that on 12th Nov 2021, AJ Hackett staff had requested him to send 
his tickets? media code to them to secure a slot. Guest thus replied and forwarded the 
email to staff and had a confirmation for the 15th of Nov 2021. (Please see attached) 
 
On the 15th Nov 2021, Monday, he had used 55 tokens for the Giant Swing Component
from each of the stated tickets and kept the 45 tokens for another day's use. 

On the 28th of Mar 2022, Guest has approached harbor front Cable Car ticketing counter
to redeem for Sky Pass round trip, but was informed by the staff that he has got no tokens 
left. 

Feeling disappointed and helpless, but surely knowing that he had not used the tickets, 
 Guest logged onto Sentosa Website to have a live chat to seek help. He then found out from 
the live chat that his remaining tokens (45 from each ticket) were fully deducted at Summer 
House AJ Hackett. He had also enquired details from the Live Chat to when the tokens were 
deducted. He was informed that it was deducted on 23rd Nov 2021. 

Guest called up Summerhouse to enquire and was informed by Staff that they would be closed 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The staff also informed that it is not possible to have a deduction 
of tokens as 23rd Nov was a Tuesday. Guest confirmed and was extremely sure that he had not 
used the tickets anywhere during this period. He is puzzled on how a ticket can be deducted 
at a location which is closed. 

Upon checking at the POS system (see attached), it appears that both the tickets had a deduction
Of 45 tokens between 15:37 to 15:38hrs. 

Guest believes that this might be a case of Fraud and would like to know if there is any 
Way to find how the tokens was deducted.

Subject: Sentosa Fun Pass Token Issue

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you with regards to an issue with the Sentosa Fun Pass tokens that I had purchased.  

I purchased 2 vouchers x 100 tokens each on 9 November 2021 (please see attached funpass tokens in PDF file). On 15 November 2021, I went down to AJ Hackket at sentosa and used the tokens to redeem the Giant Swing activity. The activity used 2 x 55 tokens. Hence, I had 2 x 45 tokens remaining. I did not use any further tokens apart from the giant swing activity. On a side note, it may be useful to note that I was told to email my token vouchers to AJ Hackket in order to confirm my booking for the giant swing. Hence, AJ Hackket had a copy of my vouchers. 

Subsequently, in or around March 2022,  i made a trip down to harbourfront centre intending to redeem my tokens for the cable car ride. When i scanned my token at the counter, i was informed by the counter that I had 0 tokens remaining. I told the counter staff i was certain that i had 2 x 45 tokens remaining. I was then advised to contact sentosa for this issue. 

I proceeded to use the live chat function on the sentosa website hoping to resolve the issue. Please see enclosed a copy of the chat transcript. I was informed that my tokens were used trice at AJ Hackett summerhouse on 23 November 2021 at 3.30pm. I was told to contact AJ Hackket directly to resolve the issue. Apart from that, the staff was unable to assist me further. 

I contacted AJ Hackket, and the staff from AJ Hackket informed me that it was not possible that the tokens were used on 23 November 2021 because that was a Tuesday and they were closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and they were unable to assist me further. I am extremely certain that i could have have used the tokens that day as i was at work on a Tuesday afternoon.

Feeling exasperated that no one could help me in this matter, I made a trip down all the way to the sentosa counter at beach station on 3 April 2022. I explained the matter to a staff member called Pravina. Pravina offered great service and tried to assist me the best she could but unfortunately, I was told that there was nothing she could do at that moment but she would help me email upper management to help resolve the issue. 

To date, my issue has yet to be resolved and I have exhausted all means to rectify the problem. I believe the tokens were either fraudulently used by a member of AJ Hackket staff (as they have a copy of my token voucher which i sent across when reserving the giant swing activity) or there is a major flaw in the token system. 

I seek your kind assistance in resolving this issue as I have made considerable effort to get it resolved but to no avail. Thank you and i look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Jay"	"From: Kevin Soo WenWei

Hi Sylvia,

To return back 45 tokens (15 token x3) to media code 10129C1T4H3XD1, can we know the ticket will extend to when?
SH: there should be 2 media codes that we are returning the tokens to. 45 tokens per media code, therefore, in total, 90 tokens to be returned to guest (attached Mstr Admission Report for 23 Nov?21 deductions).
10129C1T4H3XD1
1836K03DEP51RY

@Jia En, will need your help to advise on the token face value to be given back for 45 tokens.


Thank You.

Hi Abby, 

Thanks for the follow up. To be clear, we did speak to Kelly to explain the purpose of the verification.

We will proceed to extend the validity of the tickets and return the deducted tokens to guest for them to enjoy our activities when they return to SG. Can GIE please route this to BP alongside the FP extension form for our processing. 

@ Yong Lin: pls prioritise to close this FP extension request by next Wed, 04/05

Hi Sylvia & Team,
 
Spoke to Mr Jay about 5 minutes ago as he was boarding a flight (cabin crew was asking him to switch his phone off). Kelly who is his girlfriend is with him. The two of them are travelling home and will be back on the 9th of May. Understand that the tickets are expiring on the 7th of May. Mr Jay has asked due to this, are we able to somehow extend his tickets so he can use this straight away when he gets back? If not, then are we able to possibly seek for a refund for this guest?
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Have a wonderful long weekend!

Hi Eunice, 
 
Thanks for the quick catch up this morning. As discussed, GIE will proceed to contact islander, Kelly Lee to confirm that she has passed her 2 x 100 tokens Fun Pass to guest, Jay. Once we ascertain this, we can proceed to reload the 45 tokens to each of the Fun Passes. 
 
Let?s target to close the loop with Jay by next week. Also need GIE to submit the Fun Pass extension form for Jacq?s approval before their expiry on 7 May.

Hi Eunice,
 
Will we have an issue how we will handle if Kelly Lee comes back to dispute some time later?
I think it is important to establish that Kelly Lee and Jay knows each other. Otherwise we are ?returning? to the wrong person. QR codd tickets can be fabricated too easily so I suggest we exercise caution in this case.

Jacq.

Thanks Sylvia. 
 
Per guest transcript, the guest is checking for 2 tickets.
I do not suggest that we reach out to ?Kelly Lee? as the touchpoint is Jay whom had provided the legit media codes for checking. 
Islander member could have purchased it as a gift or transferred the voucher to her guest and in Funpass T&C, we didn?t state that its not-transferable. 
 
In this case where Jay is already agitated, we do not recommend to add in another party to the picture as the resolution has no bearing to ticket purchaser as well. 
Unless we are planning for direct voucher refund/ etc or let me know what is the impact to the ticket purchaser? 
 
Cheers, 
Eunice

Hi Eunice,
 
Before we close our follow up with Jay (guest who raised this issue), we need GIE?s assistance to verify with islander, Kelly Lee that she has indeed passed her 
2 x Fun Pass, 100 tokens to Jay for use. We like to ensure that we have done the necessary background checks before closing this case with service recovery and an explanation proper to Jay. 
 
Separately, AJH is agreeable on the claw back of the deducted 6 x 15 tokens (90 tokens). For investigation part of things, we will update separately once we have further discussion with them.
 
@GIE team: Please help to clarify on the following with regards to Jay?s Live Chat enquiry:
1.	Guest was checking the status for 1 ticket or 2 tickets? 2 tickets 
2.	When he went to Harbourfront cable car counter ? it was for redemption of Sky Pass from 1 or 2 tickets? 2 tickets 
 
@Pravina Nair Revindran: 
1.	Did we share with guest that both his tickets were deducted of 45 tokens each? I.e. Guest is aware that a total of 90 tokens were deduced?

Sylvia

Hi Eunice,
Internally the investigations were already done as summarized in my email. The deductions were made using AJH?s MV. Vendor suggest AJ to check their CCTV but due to the lag, not so sure if they will still have the footage from last year November.

Thanks Jornus. 
 
Let me be aligned with the investigations. 
1.	Guest?s claims is legit, i.e. there?s a ?shortfall? of 45 tokens in her free token pass. 
2.	Checks with IP/ system reflect that 45 token was deducted. But unable to validate ?WHO? did that 3 transactions 
 
2 parts to this case as next steps: 
 
For guest, we have to make it right if the problem is on us. Suggest to reload the 45 tokens and communicate to guest that this is done before the expiry date. If we need to take longer, then please let us know by when and if we can extend the expiry date. Otherwise, we may need to consider alternative to close the case with guest. 
 
For ourselves, can we get a proper investigation on this please? Sounds like a potential fraud or process gap. 
 
Cheers,

Hi Eunice,
Need some advice on how we should proceed with this case.
SBCD did some investigations and have the following information:
 
1.	This screen shot shows that there are 3 deductions made on the Sentosa Fun Pass 100 Token on 23 Nov 2021 at 3.37pm
Media Code 10129C1T4H3XD1, ticket is valid till 7 May 2022. But 0 token left now.
 
 
2.	Catherine had spoken to AJH?s manager and was informed that they are closed on 23 Nov 2021, Tuesday. So usage was not possible. 
3.	This is a free fun pass that was given out due to our F&B voucher promotion. 
4.	We also noted that the person who complaint was ?Jay? but from the purchase history, the person who purchased it was islander ?Lee, Kelly?.
 
 
From understanding, we should be able to add the 45 tokens back to the ticket from the backend by having COE help to do a ticket update. Jason/Yuki please confirm.
Also we will need BP team to liaise with AJH to claw back the settlement paid to them.
 
For your advice, thank you.
 
Regards
Jornus

Thanks YL on the quick turnaround.
 
@COE ? could we also verify on the backend that these were indeed tapped at AJ and redeemed? Hopefully, it?s not a case of hardware issue with the discrepancies in AJ reports we have been seeing these couple of weeks.

Hi, like to follow up on this.
 
1.	Outcome of AJH investigation?
This was way back in Nov?21, Z did a check with the ground ops and AJ was closed on that day (none of the staff was onsite). On the POS history checks, understand that redemption is shown to be at AJ for 3 x 15 tokens of $20 F&B credit which is mysterious. @Jason TEO (SENTOSA)/@Yuki SHI (SENTOSA) ? can we verify this on the backend again? Attached the screenshots and media codes.
2.	Guests came back beach station today.
He highlighted he wrote to GIE and did not receive a reply.
Noted now that guest is expecting a reply from us. As this was a long time back, AJ?s investigation may be lacking with the time lapse. @Yong Lin PHUA (SENTOSA) ? are we able to check AJ billing report in Nov?21 on the payment for attached 2 media codes redeemed in Nov?21? If payment is made to AJ, we will request for their service recovery to this guest.
 
When #1 is ready, we should update GIE, so they can respond to guest accordingly.
 
Thank you.

Hi Fabian, Pravina,
 
Thanks for sharing this incident. Spoke to Z earlier.
 
AJH follows up with all the Chope reservations with an email to guest to verify that they are actual Fun Pass holders by requesting for the media codes as they have had many cases of ?false? bookings when guests do not have a Fun Pass or ?no-shows?. They do not however, perform a pre-redemption of these codes. IP is aware that all redemptions have to be made onsite upon guest arrival.
 
For this case, I will also send it to Z for his investigations with their ground ops.
 
Cheers
Catherine

Hi Fabian,
 
Thanks for flagging this.
 
We are not aware that AJH is practicing early redemption as part of guest?s booking confirmation, so this is new to us. 
 
We have made known to IPs that redemption needs to be done in person. For IPs, other than potentially exposing themselves to fraud i.e. staff taking media codes to redeem elsewhere, there is also the issue with token reversal - should guest decide to cancel their visit, reversal is not supported as it can only be done on the day of redemption and based on the last transaction. 
 
For this case, we will follow up with Z tomorrow and update you. 
 
+ Cat.

Subject: Guest feedback on unknown deduction of tokens 
 
Hi GIE & Team, 
 
There was a guest who approached us at Beach Ticketing Counter on a issue he was 
facing with tickets that was bought online. He had 2 tickets of 100 Tokens each 
and it was bought on the 09th Nov 2021. (Please see attached for tickets)
 
Guest recalled that on 12th Nov 2021, AJ Hackett staff had requested him to send 
his tickets? media code to them to secure a slot. Guest thus replied and forwarded the 
email to staff and had a confirmation for the 15th of Nov 2021. (Please see attached) 
 
On the 15th Nov 2021, Monday, he had used 55 tokens for the Giant Swing Component
from each of the stated tickets and kept the 45 tokens for another day's use. 
 
On the 28th of Mar 2022, Guest has approached harbor front Cable Car ticketing counter
to redeem for Sky Pass round trip, but was informed by the staff that he has got no tokens 
left. 
 
Feeling disappointed and helpless, but surely knowing that he had not used the tickets, 
 Guest logged onto Sentosa Website to have a live chat to seek help. He then found out from 
the live chat that his remaining tokens (45 from each ticket) were fully deducted at Summer 
House AJ Hackett. He had also enquired details from the Live Chat to when the tokens were 
deducted. He was informed that it was deducted on 23rd Nov 2021. 
 
Guest called up Summerhouse to enquire and was informed by Staff that they would be closed 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The staff also informed that it is not possible to have a deduction 
of tokens as 23rd Nov was a Tuesday. Guest confirmed and was extremely sure that he had not 
used the tickets anywhere during this period. He is puzzled on how a ticket can be deducted 
at a location which is closed. 
 
Upon checking at the POS system (see attached), it appears that both the tickets had a deduction
Of 45 tokens between 15:37 to 15:38hrs. 
 
Guest believes that this might be a case of Fraud and would like to know if there is any 
Way to find how the tokens was deducted.

Thank You.

Hi Eunice,
Internally the investigations were already done as summarized in my email. The deductions were made using AJH?s MV. Vendor suggest AJ to check their CCTV but due to the lag, not so sure if they will still have the footage from last year November.

Need some advice on how we should proceed with this case.
SBCD did some investigations and have the following information:

1.	This screen shot shows that there are 3 deductions made on the Sentosa Fun Pass 100 Token on 23 Nov 2021 at 3.37pm
Media Code 10129C1T4H3XD1, ticket is valid till 7 May 2022. But 0 token left now.
 

2.	Catherine had spoken to AJH?s manager and was informed that they are closed on 23 Nov 2021, Tuesday. So usage was not possible. 
3.	This is a free fun pass that was given out due to our F&B voucher promotion. 
4.	We also noted that the person who complaint was ?Jay? but from the purchase history, the person who purchased it was islander ?Lee, Kelly?.
 

From understanding, we should be able to add the 45 tokens back to the ticket from the backend by having COE help to do a ticket update. Jason/Yuki please confirm.
Also we will need BP team to liaise with AJH to claw back the settlement paid to them.

For your advice, thank you.

Regards
Jornus

As spoken,

This is one old issue from Nov last year.
Not sure what was logged at your side already.
I ran the fix new validator report attached.

Do take a look at this issue and let us know if you can tell they are genuine deduction of tokens.
Thanks!

Thanks YL on the quick turnaround.

@COE ? could we also verify on the backend that these were indeed tapped at AJ and redeemed? Hopefully, it?s not a case of hardware issue with the discrepancies in AJ reports we have been seeing these couple of weeks.

Cheers
Catherine

Hi, like to follow up on this.

1.	Outcome of AJH investigation?
This was way back in Nov?21, Z did a check with the ground ops and AJ was closed on that day (none of the staff was onsite). On the POS history checks, understand that redemption is shown to be at AJ for 3 x 15 tokens of $20 F&B credit which is mysterious. @Jason TEO (SENTOSA)/@Yuki SHI (SENTOSA) ? can we verify this on the backend again? Attached the screenshots and media codes.
2.	Guests came back beach station today.
He highlighted he wrote to GIE and did not receive a reply.
Noted now that guest is expecting a reply from us. As this was a long time back, AJ?s investigation may be lacking with the time lapse. @Yong Lin PHUA (SENTOSA) ? are we able to check AJ billing report in Nov?21 on the payment for attached 2 media codes redeemed in Nov?21? If payment is made to AJ, we will request for their service recovery to this guest.

When #1 is ready, we should update GIE, so they can respond to guest accordingly.

Thank you.

Hi Fabian, Pravina,

Thanks for sharing this incident. Spoke to Z earlier.

AJH follows up with all the Chope reservations with an email to guest to verify that they are actual Fun Pass holders by requesting for the media codes as they have had many cases of ?false? bookings when guests do not have a Fun Pass or ?no-shows?. They do not however, perform a pre-redemption of these codes. IP is aware that all redemptions have to be made onsite upon guest arrival.

For this case, I will also send it to Z for his investigations with their ground ops.

Cheers
Catherine

Hi Fabian,

Thanks for flagging this.

We are not aware that AJH is practicing early redemption as part of guest?s booking confirmation, so this is new to us. 

We have made known to IPs that redemption needs to be done in person. For IPs, other than potentially exposing themselves to fraud i.e. staff taking media codes to redeem elsewhere, there is also the issue with token reversal - should guest decide to cancel their visit, reversal is not supported as it can only be done on the day of redemption and based on the last transaction. 

For this case, we will follow up with Z tomorrow and update you. 

+ Cat.

Subject: Guest feedback on unknown deduction of tokens 

Hi GIE & Team, 
 
There was a guest who approached us at Beach Ticketing Counter on a issue he was 
facing with tickets that was bought online. He had 2 tickets of 100 Tokens each 
and it was bought on the 09th Nov 2021. (Please see attached for tickets)

Guest recalled that on 12th Nov 2021, AJ Hackett staff had requested him to send 
his tickets? media code to them to secure a slot. Guest thus replied and forwarded the 
email to staff and had a confirmation for the 15th of Nov 2021. (Please see attached) 
 
On the 15th Nov 2021, Monday, he had used 55 tokens for the Giant Swing Component
from each of the stated tickets and kept the 45 tokens for another day's use. 

On the 28th of Mar 2022, Guest has approached harbor front Cable Car ticketing counter
to redeem for Sky Pass round trip, but was informed by the staff that he has got no tokens 
left. 

Feeling disappointed and helpless, but surely knowing that he had not used the tickets, 
 Guest logged onto Sentosa Website to have a live chat to seek help. He then found out from 
the live chat that his remaining tokens (45 from each ticket) were fully deducted at Summer 
House AJ Hackett. He had also enquired details from the Live Chat to when the tokens were 
deducted. He was informed that it was deducted on 23rd Nov 2021. 

Guest called up Summerhouse to enquire and was informed by Staff that they would be closed 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The staff also informed that it is not possible to have a deduction 
of tokens as 23rd Nov was a Tuesday. Guest confirmed and was extremely sure that he had not 
used the tickets anywhere during this period. He is puzzled on how a ticket can be deducted 
at a location which is closed. 

Upon checking at the POS system (see attached), it appears that both the tickets had a deduction
Of 45 tokens between 15:37 to 15:38hrs. 

Guest believes that this might be a case of Fraud and would like to know if there is any 
Way to find how the tokens was deducted.

Thank You.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have tried all avenues to rectify this issue to no avail. 

I have yet to receive a response to my earlier email below. 

Seems that I have been cheated off my tokens with no solution nor support from the Sentosa management.

Subject: Sentosa Fun Pass Token Issue 
 
Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you with regards to an issue with the Sentosa Fun Pass tokens that I had purchased.  

I purchased 2 vouchers x 100 tokens each on 9 November 2021 (please see attached funpass tokens in PDF file). On 15 November 2021, I went down to AJ Hackket at sentosa and used the tokens to redeem the Giant Swing activity. The activity used 2 x 55 tokens. Hence, I had 2 x 45 tokens remaining. I did not use any further tokens apart from the giant swing activity. On a side note, it may be useful to note that I was told to email my token vouchers to AJ Hackket in order to confirm my booking for the giant swing. Hence, AJ Hackket had a copy of my vouchers. 

Subsequently, in or around March 2022,  i made a trip down to harbourfront centre intending to redeem my tokens for the cable car ride. When i scanned my token at the counter, i was informed by the counter that I had 0 tokens remaining. I told the counter staff i was certain that i had 2 x 45 tokens remaining. I was then advised to contact sentosa for this issue. 

I proceeded to use the live chat function on the sentosa website hoping to resolve the issue. Please see enclosed a copy of the chat transcript. I was informed that my tokens were used trice at AJ Hackett summerhouse on 23 November 2021 at 3.30pm. I was told to contact AJ Hackket directly to resolve the issue. Apart from that, the staff was unable to assist me further. 

I contacted AJ Hackket, and the staff from AJ Hackket informed me that it was not possible that the tokens were used on 23 November 2021 because that was a Tuesday and they were closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and they were unable to assist me further. I am extremely certain that i could have have used the tokens that day as i was at work on a Tuesday afternoon.

Feeling exasperated that no one could help me in this matter, I made a trip down all the way to the sentosa counter at beach station on 3 April 2022. I explained the matter to a staff member called Pravina. Pravina offered great service and tried to assist me the best she could but unfortunately, I was told that there was nothing she could do at that moment but she would help me email upper management to help resolve the issue. 

To date, my issue has yet to be resolved and I have exhausted all means to rectify the problem. I believe the tokens were either fraudulently used by a member of AJ Hackket staff (as they have a copy of my token voucher which i sent across when reserving the giant swing activity) or there is a major flaw in the token system. 

I seek your kind assistance in resolving this issue as I have made considerable effort to get it resolved but to no avail. Thank you and i look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Jay"	"From: Sylvia HENG (SENTOSA) [mailto:Sylvia_HENG@sentosa.gov.sg]

Hi Eunice,

Before we close our follow up with Jay (guest who raised this issue), we need GIE?s assistance to verify with islander, Kelly Lee that she has indeed passed her 
2 x Fun Pass, 100 tokens to Jay for use. We like to ensure that we have done the necessary background checks before closing this case with service recovery and an explanation proper to Jay. 

Separately, AJH is agreeable on the claw back of the deducted 6 x 15 tokens (90 tokens). For investigation part of things, we will update separately once we have further discussion with them.

@GIE team: Please help to clarify on the following with regards to Jay?s Live Chat enquiry:
1.	Guest was checking the status for 1 ticket or 2 tickets?
2.	When he went to Harbourfront cable car counter ? it was for redemption of Sky Pass from 1 or 2 tickets?

@Pravina Nair Revindran: 
1.	Did we share with guest that both his tickets were deducted of 45 tokens each? I.e. Guest is aware that a total of 90 tokens were deduced?

Hi Eunice,
Internally the investigations were already done as summarized in my email. The deductions were made using AJH?s MV. Vendor suggest AJ to check their CCTV but due to the lag, not so sure if they will still have the footage from last year November.

Thanks Jornus. 

Let me be aligned with the investigations. 
1.	Guest?s claims is legit, i.e. there?s a ?shortfall? of 45 tokens in her free token pass. 
2.	Checks with IP/ system reflect that 45 token was deducted. But unable to validate ?WHO? did that 3 transactions 

2 parts to this case as next steps: 

For guest, we have to make it right if the problem is on us. Suggest to reload the 45 tokens and communicate to guest that this is done before the expiry date. If we need to take longer, then please let us know by when and if we can extend the expiry date. Otherwise, we may need to consider alternative to close the case with guest. 

For ourselves, can we get a proper investigation on this please? Sounds like a potential fraud or process gap. 

Cheers, 
Eunice

Hi Eunice,
Need some advice on how we should proceed with this case.
SBCD did some investigations and have the following information:

1.	This screen shot shows that there are 3 deductions made on the Sentosa Fun Pass 100 Token on 23 Nov 2021 at 3.37pm
Media Code 10129C1T4H3XD1, ticket is valid till 7 May 2022. But 0 token left now.
 

2.	Catherine had spoken to AJH?s manager and was informed that they are closed on 23 Nov 2021, Tuesday. So usage was not possible. 
3.	This is a free fun pass that was given out due to our F&B voucher promotion. 
4.	We also noted that the person who complaint was ?Jay? but from the purchase history, the person who purchased it was islander ?Lee, Kelly?.
 

From understanding, we should be able to add the 45 tokens back to the ticket from the backend by having COE help to do a ticket update. Jason/Yuki please confirm.
Also we will need BP team to liaise with AJH to claw back the settlement paid to them.

For your advice, thank you.

Regards
Jornus

Thanks YL on the quick turnaround.

@COE ? could we also verify on the backend that these were indeed tapped at AJ and redeemed? Hopefully, it?s not a case of hardware issue with the discrepancies in AJ reports we have been seeing these couple of weeks.

Hi, like to follow up on this.

1.	Outcome of AJH investigation?
This was way back in Nov?21, Z did a check with the ground ops and AJ was closed on that day (none of the staff was onsite). On the POS history checks, understand that redemption is shown to be at AJ for 3 x 15 tokens of $20 F&B credit which is mysterious. @Jason TEO (SENTOSA)/@Yuki SHI (SENTOSA) ? can we verify this on the backend again? Attached the screenshots and media codes.
2.	Guests came back beach station today.
He highlighted he wrote to GIE and did not receive a reply.
Noted now that guest is expecting a reply from us. As this was a long time back, AJ?s investigation may be lacking with the time lapse. @Yong Lin PHUA (SENTOSA) ? are we able to check AJ billing report in Nov?21 on the payment for attached 2 media codes redeemed in Nov?21? If payment is made to AJ, we will request for their service recovery to this guest.

When #1 is ready, we should update GIE, so they can respond to guest accordingly.

Thank you.

Hi Fabian, Pravina,

Thanks for sharing this incident. Spoke to Z earlier.

AJH follows up with all the Chope reservations with an email to guest to verify that they are actual Fun Pass holders by requesting for the media codes as they have had many cases of ?false? bookings when guests do not have a Fun Pass or ?no-shows?. They do not however, perform a pre-redemption of these codes. IP is aware that all redemptions have to be made onsite upon guest arrival.

For this case, I will also send it to Z for his investigations with their ground ops.

Cheers
Catherine

Hi Fabian,

Thanks for flagging this.

We are not aware that AJH is practicing early redemption as part of guest?s booking confirmation, so this is new to us. 

We have made known to IPs that redemption needs to be done in person. For IPs, other than potentially exposing themselves to fraud i.e. staff taking media codes to redeem elsewhere, there is also the issue with token reversal - should guest decide to cancel their visit, reversal is not supported as it can only be done on the day of redemption and based on the last transaction. 

For this case, we will follow up with Z tomorrow and update you. 

+ Cat.

Subject: Guest feedback on unknown deduction of tokens 

Hi GIE & Team, 
 
There was a guest who approached us at Beach Ticketing Counter on a issue he was 
facing with tickets that was bought online. He had 2 tickets of 100 Tokens each 
and it was bought on the 09th Nov 2021. (Please see attached for tickets)

Guest recalled that on 12th Nov 2021, AJ Hackett staff had requested him to send 
his tickets? media code to them to secure a slot. Guest thus replied and forwarded the 
email to staff and had a confirmation for the 15th of Nov 2021. (Please see attached) 
 
On the 15th Nov 2021, Monday, he had used 55 tokens for the Giant Swing Component
from each of the stated tickets and kept the 45 tokens for another day's use. 

On the 28th of Mar 2022, Guest has approached harbor front Cable Car ticketing counter
to redeem for Sky Pass round trip, but was informed by the staff that he has got no tokens 
left. 

Feeling disappointed and helpless, but surely knowing that he had not used the tickets, 
 Guest logged onto Sentosa Website to have a live chat to seek help. He then found out from 
the live chat that his remaining tokens (45 from each ticket) were fully deducted at Summer 
House AJ Hackett. He had also enquired details from the Live Chat to when the tokens were 
deducted. He was informed that it was deducted on 23rd Nov 2021. 

Guest called up Summerhouse to enquire and was informed by Staff that they would be closed 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The staff also informed that it is not possible to have a deduction 
of tokens as 23rd Nov was a Tuesday. Guest confirmed and was extremely sure that he had not 
used the tickets anywhere during this period. He is puzzled on how a ticket can be deducted 
at a location which is closed. 

Upon checking at the POS system (see attached), it appears that both the tickets had a deduction
Of 45 tokens between 15:37 to 15:38hrs. 

Guest believes that this might be a case of Fraud and would like to know if there is any 
Way to find how the tokens was deducted.

Hi Abby, 

Thanks for the follow up. To be clear, we did speak to Kelly to explain the purpose of the verification.

We will proceed to extend the validity of the tickets and return the deducted tokens to guest for them to enjoy our activities when they return to SG. Can GIE please route this to BP alongside the FP extension form for our processing. 

@ Yong Lin: pls prioritise to close this FP extension request by next Wed, 04/05

Hi Sylvia & Team,
 
Spoke to Mr Jay about 5 minutes ago as he was boarding a flight (cabin crew was asking him to switch his phone off). Kelly who is his girlfriend is with him. The two of them are travelling home and will be back on the 9th of May. Understand that the tickets are expiring on the 7th of May. Mr Jay has asked due to this, are we able to somehow extend his tickets so he can use this straight away when he gets back? If not, then are we able to possibly seek for a refund for this guest?
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Have a wonderful long weekend!

Hi Eunice, 
 
Thanks for the quick catch up this morning. As discussed, GIE will proceed to contact islander, Kelly Lee to confirm that she has passed her 2 x 100 tokens Fun Pass to guest, Jay. Once we ascertain this, we can proceed to reload the 45 tokens to each of the Fun Passes. 
 
Let?s target to close the loop with Jay by next week. Also need GIE to submit the Fun Pass extension form for Jacq?s approval before their expiry on 7 May.
 
BR,
Sylvia

Hi Eunice,
 
Will we have an issue how we will handle if Kelly Lee comes back to dispute some time later?
I think it is important to establish that Kelly Lee and Jay knows each other. Otherwise we are ?returning? to the wrong person. QR codd tickets can be fabricated too easily so I suggest we exercise caution in this case.
 
Regards,
Jacq.

Thanks Sylvia. 
 
Per guest transcript, the guest is checking for 2 tickets.
I do not suggest that we reach out to ?Kelly Lee? as the touchpoint is Jay whom had provided the legit media codes for checking. 
Islander member could have purchased it as a gift or transferred the voucher to her guest and in Funpass T&C, we didn?t state that its not-transferable. 
 
In this case where Jay is already agitated, we do not recommend to add in another party to the picture as the resolution has no bearing to ticket purchaser as well. 
Unless we are planning for direct voucher refund/ etc or let me know what is the impact to the ticket purchaser? 
 
Cheers, 
Eunice

Hi Eunice,
 
Before we close our follow up with Jay (guest who raised this issue), we need GIE?s assistance to verify with islander, Kelly Lee that she has indeed passed her 
2 x Fun Pass, 100 tokens to Jay for use. We like to ensure that we have done the necessary background checks before closing this case with service recovery and an explanation proper to Jay. 
 
Separately, AJH is agreeable on the claw back of the deducted 6 x 15 tokens (90 tokens). For investigation part of things, we will update separately once we have further discussion with them.
 
@GIE team: Please help to clarify on the following with regards to Jay?s Live Chat enquiry:
1.	Guest was checking the status for 1 ticket or 2 tickets? 2 tickets 
2.	When he went to Harbourfront cable car counter ? it was for redemption of Sky Pass from 1 or 2 tickets? 2 tickets 
 
@Pravina Nair Revindran: 
1.	Did we share with guest that both his tickets were deducted of 45 tokens each? I.e. Guest is aware that a total of 90 tokens were deduced?

Sylvia

Hi Eunice,
Internally the investigations were already done as summarized in my email. The deductions were made using AJH?s MV. Vendor suggest AJ to check their CCTV but due to the lag, not so sure if they will still have the footage from last year November.

Subject: RE: [TAPSD-487] Guest feedback on unknown deduction of tokens 
 
Thanks Jornus. 
 
Let me be aligned with the investigations. 
1.	Guest?s claims is legit, i.e. there?s a ?shortfall? of 45 tokens in her free token pass. 
2.	Checks with IP/ system reflect that 45 token was deducted. But unable to validate ?WHO? did that 3 transactions 
 
2 parts to this case as next steps: 
 
For guest, we have to make it right if the problem is on us. Suggest to reload the 45 tokens and communicate to guest that this is done before the expiry date. If we need to take longer, then please let us know by when and if we can extend the expiry date. Otherwise, we may need to consider alternative to close the case with guest. 
 
For ourselves, can we get a proper investigation on this please? Sounds like a potential fraud or process gap. 
 
Cheers, 
Eunice

Hi Eunice,
Need some advice on how we should proceed with this case.
SBCD did some investigations and have the following information:
 
1.	This screen shot shows that there are 3 deductions made on the Sentosa Fun Pass 100 Token on 23 Nov 2021 at 3.37pm
Media Code 10129C1T4H3XD1, ticket is valid till 7 May 2022. But 0 token left now.
 
 
2.	Catherine had spoken to AJH?s manager and was informed that they are closed on 23 Nov 2021, Tuesday. So usage was not possible. 
3.	This is a free fun pass that was given out due to our F&B voucher promotion. 
4.	We also noted that the person who complaint was ?Jay? but from the purchase history, the person who purchased it was islander ?Lee, Kelly?.
 
 
From understanding, we should be able to add the 45 tokens back to the ticket from the backend by having COE help to do a ticket update. Jason/Yuki please confirm.
Also we will need BP team to liaise with AJH to claw back the settlement paid to them.
 
For your advice, thank you.
 
Regards
Jornus

Thanks YL on the quick turnaround.
 
@COE ? could we also verify on the backend that these were indeed tapped at AJ and redeemed? Hopefully, it?s not a case of hardware issue with the discrepancies in AJ reports we have been seeing these couple of weeks.

Hi, like to follow up on this.
 
1.	Outcome of AJH investigation?
This was way back in Nov?21, Z did a check with the ground ops and AJ was closed on that day (none of the staff was onsite). On the POS history checks, understand that redemption is shown to be at AJ for 3 x 15 tokens of $20 F&B credit which is mysterious. @Jason TEO (SENTOSA)/@Yuki SHI (SENTOSA) ? can we verify this on the backend again? Attached the screenshots and media codes.
2.	Guests came back beach station today.
He highlighted he wrote to GIE and did not receive a reply.
Noted now that guest is expecting a reply from us. As this was a long time back, AJ?s investigation may be lacking with the time lapse. @Yong Lin PHUA (SENTOSA) ? are we able to check AJ billing report in Nov?21 on the payment for attached 2 media codes redeemed in Nov?21? If payment is made to AJ, we will request for their service recovery to this guest.
 
When #1 is ready, we should update GIE, so they can respond to guest accordingly.
 
Thank you.

Hi Fabian, Pravina,
 
Thanks for sharing this incident. Spoke to Z earlier.
 
AJH follows up with all the Chope reservations with an email to guest to verify that they are actual Fun Pass holders by requesting for the media codes as they have had many cases of ?false? bookings when guests do not have a Fun Pass or ?no-shows?. They do not however, perform a pre-redemption of these codes. IP is aware that all redemptions have to be made onsite upon guest arrival.
 
For this case, I will also send it to Z for his investigations with their ground ops.
 
Cheers
Catherine

Hi Fabian,
 
Thanks for flagging this.
 
We are not aware that AJH is practicing early redemption as part of guest?s booking confirmation, so this is new to us. 
 
We have made known to IPs that redemption needs to be done in person. For IPs, other than potentially exposing themselves to fraud i.e. staff taking media codes to redeem elsewhere, there is also the issue with token reversal - should guest decide to cancel their visit, reversal is not supported as it can only be done on the day of redemption and based on the last transaction. 
 
For this case, we will follow up with Z tomorrow and update you. 
 
+ Cat.

Subject: Guest feedback on unknown deduction of tokens 
 
Hi GIE & Team, 
 
There was a guest who approached us at Beach Ticketing Counter on a issue he was 
facing with tickets that was bought online. He had 2 tickets of 100 Tokens each 
and it was bought on the 09th Nov 2021. (Please see attached for tickets)
 
Guest recalled that on 12th Nov 2021, AJ Hackett staff had requested him to send 
his tickets? media code to them to secure a slot. Guest thus replied and forwarded the 
email to staff and had a confirmation for the 15th of Nov 2021. (Please see attached) 
 
On the 15th Nov 2021, Monday, he had used 55 tokens for the Giant Swing Component
from each of the stated tickets and kept the 45 tokens for another day's use. 
 
On the 28th of Mar 2022, Guest has approached harbor front Cable Car ticketing counter
to redeem for Sky Pass round trip, but was informed by the staff that he has got no tokens 
left. 
 
Feeling disappointed and helpless, but surely knowing that he had not used the tickets, 
 Guest logged onto Sentosa Website to have a live chat to seek help. He then found out from 
the live chat that his remaining tokens (45 from each ticket) were fully deducted at Summer 
House AJ Hackett. He had also enquired details from the Live Chat to when the tokens were 
deducted. He was informed that it was deducted on 23rd Nov 2021. 
 
Guest called up Summerhouse to enquire and was informed by Staff that they would be closed 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The staff also informed that it is not possible to have a deduction 
of tokens as 23rd Nov was a Tuesday. Guest confirmed and was extremely sure that he had not 
used the tickets anywhere during this period. He is puzzled on how a ticket can be deducted 
at a location which is closed. 
 
Upon checking at the POS system (see attached), it appears that both the tickets had a deduction
Of 45 tokens between 15:37 to 15:38hrs. 
 
Guest believes that this might be a case of Fraud and would like to know if there is any 
Way to find how the tokens was deducted.

Hi Eunice,
Need some advice on how we should proceed with this case.
SBCD did some investigations and have the following information:

1.	This screen shot shows that there are 3 deductions made on the Sentosa Fun Pass 100 Token on 23 Nov 2021 at 3.37pm
Media Code 10129C1T4H3XD1, ticket is valid till 7 May 2022. But 0 token left now.
 

2.	Catherine had spoken to AJH?s manager and was informed that they are closed on 23 Nov 2021, Tuesday. So usage was not possible. 
3.	This is a free fun pass that was given out due to our F&B voucher promotion. 
4.	We also noted that the person who complaint was ?Jay? but from the purchase history, the person who purchased it was islander ?Lee, Kelly?.
 

From understanding, we should be able to add the 45 tokens back to the ticket from the backend by having COE help to do a ticket update. Jason/Yuki please confirm.
Also we will need BP team to liaise with AJH to claw back the settlement paid to them.

For your advice, thank you.

Regards
Jornus

Thanks YL on the quick turnaround.

@COE ? could we also verify on the backend that these were indeed tapped at AJ and redeemed? Hopefully, it?s not a case of hardware issue with the discrepancies in AJ reports we have been seeing these couple of weeks.

Cheers
Catherine

Hi, like to follow up on this.

1.	Outcome of AJH investigation?
This was way back in Nov?21, Z did a check with the ground ops and AJ was closed on that day (none of the staff was onsite). On the POS history checks, understand that redemption is shown to be at AJ for 3 x 15 tokens of $20 F&B credit which is mysterious. @Jason TEO (SENTOSA)/@Yuki SHI (SENTOSA) ? can we verify this on the backend again? Attached the screenshots and media codes.
2.	Guests came back beach station today.
He highlighted he wrote to GIE and did not receive a reply.
Noted now that guest is expecting a reply from us. As this was a long time back, AJ?s investigation may be lacking with the time lapse. @Yong Lin PHUA (SENTOSA) ? are we able to check AJ billing report in Nov?21 on the payment for attached 2 media codes redeemed in Nov?21? If payment is made to AJ, we will request for their service recovery to this guest.

When #1 is ready, we should update GIE, so they can respond to guest accordingly.

Thank you.

Hi Fabian, Pravina,

Thanks for sharing this incident. Spoke to Z earlier.

AJH follows up with all the Chope reservations with an email to guest to verify that they are actual Fun Pass holders by requesting for the media codes as they have had many cases of ?false? bookings when guests do not have a Fun Pass or ?no-shows?. They do not however, perform a pre-redemption of these codes. IP is aware that all redemptions have to be made onsite upon guest arrival.

For this case, I will also send it to Z for his investigations with their ground ops.

Cheers
Catherine

Hi Fabian,

Thanks for flagging this.

We are not aware that AJH is practicing early redemption as part of guest?s booking confirmation, so this is new to us. 

We have made known to IPs that redemption needs to be done in person. For IPs, other than potentially exposing themselves to fraud i.e. staff taking media codes to redeem elsewhere, there is also the issue with token reversal - should guest decide to cancel their visit, reversal is not supported as it can only be done on the day of redemption and based on the last transaction. 

For this case, we will follow up with Z tomorrow and update you. 

+ Cat.
