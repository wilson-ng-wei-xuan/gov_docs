Dear Kai Jie,

Greetings from Sentosa!

We refer to our last email on 25 May 2022 and for allowing us some time to look into on your feedback.

We understand that you made a reservation on 20 May 2022 at Bones 'n' Barrel for a dinner event with balloons order from Mistrydaydream. The balloons were accepted by the staff working the day shift and when you are present at the restaurant later in the day to retrieved the balloons as the dinner event was cancelled. The balloons were nowhere to be found after visual inspection of the premises and staff present that night informed you that no balloons were present at the venue.

With that being said, Bones 'n' Barrel have conducted an investigation and it was found that due to lapse in communication the day shift staff did not informed the staff taking over the night shift that the balloons for Mr. Tan were placed in the storage room. It was only discovered 2 to 3 days later after the compliant was lodged and they have tried to contact you for retrieval of the items but was declined. The restaurant have assessed that since the balloons were customized it is unlikely for their staff to pocket the balloons for personal possession. 

Nonetheless, Bone's 'n' Barrel have since implemented new measures for post-shift handover check controls as improvement to better communication amongst their staff and to avoid such future occurrence.

Mr. Tan, on behalf of our Island Partners please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused and we look forward to welcoming you again to Sentosa.

Warm Regards,

Dear Kevin,

I do not see any value to forward this feedback to the Bones and Barrel customer service team where it appears that their own manager and staffs seems to deliberately kept the items from the guest and the balloon company, Mistrydaydream, where they tried to retrieve the balloons from the stated restaurant on the very actual day. 

I view this matter seriously as it portrays dishonest misappropriation of property (Section 403 of the Penal Code) and caused annoyance to event (PROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT ACT 2014). They only decided to admit on 22 May 2022 at about 1745hrs, after 2 days of the event, when they were realized that Mistrydaydream is conducting their company investigation through email at 1703hrs. Such attitude and crime acts were not tolerable, may I know how else I could escalate this matter through Sentosa Management.

Thank you.

Regards,
Kai Jie

Feedback No : 05-22-00093324"	"Hi GIE

With reference to the case, B&B had investigated internally.

The customer had ordered balloons to be delivered to the restaurant without their prior knowledge. Nobody knew the balloons were meant for Tan?s dinner event. 

Tan had cancelled his dinner that day and turned up at the restaurant to retrieve his balloons. As the balloons were accepted by staff in the day shift, the information was not passed on to the next shift. After inspecting the restaurant visually, ground staff present had told Tan that there were no balloons at the restaurant.

B&B had assessed that the staff is unlikely to pocket the balloons for personal possession as they were found in the storeroom 2-3 days after Tan lodged a complaint. Moreover, balloons were customised, thus, making it more difficult for one to retain for own use.

Upon discovery, the restaurant had rang Tan to collect his balloons but was declined.

B&B had since implemented post-shift handover check controls as improvement to better communication amongst their staff and to avoid such future occurrence.

Thank you.

Regards,
Charmaine
