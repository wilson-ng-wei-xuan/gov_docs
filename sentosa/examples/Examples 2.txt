Feedback on Madame Tussauds (MT) ticketing a) It is noted that the last admission is 5 pm. b) Just after 4pm, I am UNABLE to purchase either (i) the ticket at a promotional price for NTUC income members across the MT counter (refer:https://www.income.com.sg/treats/n2022-general--madame-tussauds-singapore); or (ii) the sentosa package ""Madame Tussauds 5in1 + Digipass Adult + Free CC"" @ $30 online The reason provided by the staff is that the system does not allow such transactions described in (i) and (ii) after 4pm; and yet allows purchasing a ticket at full-price. Why can't one purchase a discounted ticket after 4pm? This rule is not stated any where in any T&Cs or FAQs. A dissatisfied MT visitor."	"Hi Kevin,
