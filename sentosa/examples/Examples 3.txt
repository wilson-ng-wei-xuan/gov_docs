Hi Zalikha,

Fyi, Kenneth came down to SDC reception yesterday to feedback that he was very upset that we have yet to address his concern for the 1st incident and the 2nd incident was a reoccurrence.  I happened to be at the reception area with ACE Sak Hin when Kenneth asked to speak to someone pertaining to his earlier feedback.  Both me and Sak Hin had engaged him and assured that we will look into the matter expeditiously.

Do let me know if you need me to help to speak to him once SAT revert with the findings of the case. Thanks.

Hi,

Our supervisors take photos of the situation on ground to update our work group to ensure timely intervention (i.e. ramp up tram services ) is done during peak periods. This also for us to keep as a record of the past status of the peak period. They did not take photos of the guest who wrote in as they do not have any interest in taking photos of him / her neither do they have the time to do so.

Even the picture attached by the guest shows that it is the general situation of the tram stop and not focusing on any particular person in the group. Below is the pictures shared by the supervisors in our work group at the said date and time. The last picture of Siloso point is taken from a far angle where no one?s face is recognizable. The supervisors have been briefed to take pictures only of the situation at the location and not focus on any particular guest.

Please advise if this practice of taking pictures for situational awareness is not allowed with guests in the pictures so that we can inform our supervisors to stop this practice immediately.

Hi Eunice,

Spoke to Mr Chua. He apologised for being sensitive and also asked me to convey his apologies to the staff he wrongfully accused after explaining why the drivers concerned were taking photos. Mr Chua has also mentioned that he was offered a job at GO Green and did not want to compromise him getting the job which was why he was upset those two dates. 

He has since signed a contract with GO Green and now understands that the drivers who are team supervisors, took photos of the situation on the ground as part of reporting and not of him. Call ended amiably. 

Aside to CMU

Can we log in this case please. Actions taken as above. Thank you!
