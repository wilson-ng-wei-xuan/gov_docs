Dear Ms. Chew,

Greetings from Sentosa!

Thank you for your feedback.

We are in the midst of looking into your concerns. Please be advised that we have redirected your email to Guest Services who will assist with this investigation.

In the interim, are we able to find out if you approached the bus driver to advise him that there were some passengers unmasked?

We look forward to hearing from you soon.


Warm Regards,

Dear Ms. Chew,

Greetings from Sentosa!

Thank you for your kind patience and understanding as we work with the relevant department to address your concerns.

We would like to inform you that the safety of our guests is of paramount importance at Sentosa. Drivers are briefed daily on the evolving SMM guidelines and are also reminded during their daily briefings that passengers must wear their masks whilst on our transport. 

We have investigated and have noted that the driver may have been unaware. The driver concerned has been counselled accordingly. 

Once again, thank you for bringing this to our attention and we look forward to your continuous support on the island.


Warm Regards,
Miki

Hi Kader,

We have received a feedback today with regards to a guest encountering passengers on Bus A yesterday (11/04) at approximately 1632HRS not wearing masks.

Are we able to find out if drivers would advise passengers accordingly on mask-wearing?

Have appended guest?s feedback below. We look forward to your response.


I would like to feedback on bus service. On 11/4/22, we took bus service A from Beach station at about 4.32pm, there was a group of people on the bus without their mask on. The bus driver didn?t take any action. This is unacceptable as the bus is enclosed & it posed a risk to other passengers on board, moreover I was traveling with an elderly, please take the necessary actions as this is an offence. Please let me know if this is not the correct channel to report this incident. Thank you.

Hi Miki,

Mask on is compulsory for guests in all transport vehicles, incl. Trams, buses, trains, and vans align with the public transport practice.

The bus captain said that he was unaware that a group of guests had removed their masks during that feedbak, causing inconvenience to other users. If the bus captain is aware of the mask-off group, they will approach. 

Every captain was reminded of the daily briefing.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Weng Hong
