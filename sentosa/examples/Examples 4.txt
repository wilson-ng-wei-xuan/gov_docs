Body:
Dear Mr. Andrew,

Greetings from Sentosa!

Thank you for your email.

Please allow us to share that our monorail doors are automated and will remain open for a pre-set amount of time. When the monorail arrives at the station, the monorail doors will open to allow guests who are on the monorail to disembark first before guests at the platform are able to enter the monorail. Once the chiming sound goes off to indicate impending closure of the doors, our platform staff will take cue from this and advise platform guests who are still in the queue to wait for the next monorail before chaining up the queue line.

During peak periods, there will be additional amount of time required for alighting guests to disembark and vacate the entrances of the monorail. This will then impact the amount of time for platform guests to get onboard the monorail. We understand there are guests who are eager to get onboard the monorail and we would also like to ensure smooth movement of guests from the ground level to the platform and from the platform onto the monorail. Thus, our staff will encourage guests at the platform to quicken their pace as they make their way onto the monorail as we note there are guests who are unaware of the amount of time which the monorail doors will remain open and may be disappointed that they are required to wait for the next monorail should they miss the current one.

Mr Andrew, thank you once again for taking the time to share your feedback with us. It is important for us that our guests have a positive experience on the island and we will continue to look into ways for improvement.

We appreciate your continuous support of Sentosa and have a great week.

Warm Regards,
Kevin

Hi Kevin,

Follow up on the feedback. Have reviewed the CCTV.

Guest arrived on platform at 0946hrs. He was the last person in the queue line waiting to board the train.
As per procedure, when train arrived, staff will let guests in the train to alight first before allowing guests to board.
During this time, there was large ingress crowd alighting from the train before SA Ryan opened up the chain to allow the guests on platform to board the train.

The guest can be seen moving through the queue line to board the train while looking at his hand phone.
Due to the large ingress crowd, only half of the guest on platform were able to board the train, the other half was stopped by SA Ryan as the train and platform doors were closing.
The guest was one of them who was stopped. As the guest was using his handphone, he may not be aware that the train door bell has rang and it is time for the train to depart.

It can be seen on the CCTV that guest then approached staff, SA Sufi, and had a conversation. 
The guest asked why he was stopped and SA Sufi had explained to the guest that the trains are running on automated mode and have timings to adhere to.
For the safety of the guest, he was stopped from entering the train that was about to depart.

From the CCTV footage and also through cross-checking with the staff involved, we can ascertain that there was no dispute and neither was the staff being rude to the guests.

We seek the guest?s understanding that the safety of our guests remains our priority.
Best regards,
Dian Hartini

Hi Kevin,

To add on, the timeline and details are as followed; 

9.45am: Blue train at Beach Station 
9.46am: Guest on platform while Blue train was still at Station loading guests. 
Guest was following queue and looking at his hand phone and walking slowly. Train door then closes.
(train dwell time was 1min20sec) Hence, guest had to wait next train. 
9.48am: Guest approached SA Ryan and Sufi to argue why did not let them in
9.49am: Pink train arrived 
9.50am: Guest boarded the train

Thank you for reaching out to guest :)

Best regards,
Dian Hartini
