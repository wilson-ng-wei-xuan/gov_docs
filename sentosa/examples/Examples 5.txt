Dear Miki,

Thank you for following up my email.

For the information you asked for, pls refer to below :

1) Exact location. 
- Pls refer to the link. Is is near the decending slope of the platform (she is walking from vivo towards Sentosa direction.)

https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gbp9HC7gcwVPJJeDA

2) Photos
- Unfortunately there is pictures taken due to the sudden shock and my daughter's friend was busy trying his best to stop the bleeding (Few kind passerby stopped by to help) the thought of taking pictures was never in their mind. They only focus on stopping the bleeding and to rush to the hospital the soonest.

We hope the management will conduct checks on the planks to prevent such accident. Enclosed herewith doctor's findings. I just want to let you know how serious this injury is. She was referred to orthopaedic to check on any bone inflammation.

Once again, I thank you for following up with me. Do contact me if you need more information. 

Thank you.

Best regards,

Mrs Ong
