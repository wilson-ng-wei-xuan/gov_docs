Registration & Enrolment::
7)	Are parents still required to register students for the 2023 MOC Programme?
Yes. PSOEB will provide schools with customised Form links to the Course Registration Form that parents will need to complete to register their child for the Programme. Parents will need to log in using their SingPass. Foreign students whose parents/guardians do not have SingPass can use a hard copy version of the Form. Please note that the Course Registration Form has been updated for the 2023 MOC Programme. Please check that parents are using the correct version.

8)	Are all students required to go for a medical examination as part of the registration process?  
Parents/Guardians of all students participating in the 2023 MOC Programme will be required to go for a medical examination to be certified fit for participation by a medical doctor.    

9)	Is there a specific type of doctor who is qualified to conduct the medical examination? 
MOE has arranged for a contracted medical service provider for the medical certification. Alternatively, any General Practitioner (GP) is qualified to assess the current health status of the student for the purposes of the Programme. However, students with pre-existing conditions are advised to go back to their attending family doctor or specialist as the attending doctor would be most familiar with the student’s medical history. 
Do note that many polyclinics do not provide this medical examination service. Please do call the polyclinic to check before making an appointment. 

10)	Is tetanus vaccination a requirement? What if the student cannot remember the date of the tetanus vaccination and have lost their Health Booklet?  
Yes, it is compulsory for students participating in the programme to have valid tetanus immunisation. It is a basic form of protection against bacteria that may be introduced through cuts and scrapes that could be sustained as part of the outdoor experience. 

Parents can go to the Health Promotion Board website to access the date of their child’s tetanus immunisation (https://www.nir.hpb.gov.sg). Parents will need to have a SingPass to access this information.  

Your child should take the tetanus vaccination 2 months before the course to facilitate smooth enrolment.

11)	Can a student who is allergic to grass/dust participate in the OBS Course?  
More information on the condition will need to be provided to OBS before it can be ascertained if the student who is allergic to grass/dust can be supported for the OBS Course. Parents should declare all medical conditions, including all types of allergies, in the Course Registration Form. The declaration is important to ensure that OBS can ensure the necessary support and resources for students to participate in the MOE-OBS Challenge programme safely. The safety of the student is of paramount importance and the student may participate only if it is assessed that it is safe to do so. Any undeclared medical condition may impact the student’s participation in the OBS Course. 
12)	How do we update medical information (new condition) after previous declaration?
You may provide the new medical information to your school and the school will advise you on the next steps. 

13)	What if my child has xxx condition, can he/she be enrolled? 
You may indicate your child's medical conditions in the registration form and our medical team will assess your child's suitability in participating the programme.

14)	Will students with special needs be able to attend the Course?  
OBS reviews our enrolment policies, capabilities, and resources regularly with MOE to support students with special needs.
While we are not be able to enrol all students with varying degree of special needs, in some instances, OBS might require the presence of the school staff (e.g., AED LBS or teacher) as a condition for enrolment to ensure the student is well-supported throughout his/her participation in the Course. In such cases, the school’s support is crucial for the successful enrolment of these students.
15)	Students with the below listed condition(s) will not be enrolled/ non-admission
•	Epilepsy / fits / seizures – Any episodes or on medication within the last 2 years;
